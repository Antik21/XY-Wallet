alwaysApply: false

CONTEXT
This project has a dedicated server module (`server/`). All architecture and maintenance
rules for the server live in a separate document.

RULE
- Follow the server rules in: @server/AGENTS.md
- Treat `server/AGENTS.md` as the single source of truth for server structure, libraries,
  configuration, request/response formats, and extension guidelines.

REFERENCES
@server/AGENTS.md
