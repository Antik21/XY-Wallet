# Project AGENTS Guide

This file describes the structure and maintenance conventions for the entire project.
It will be expanded over time.

## Server module

All server-specific architecture and maintenance instructions are documented in:
`server/AGENTS.md`

Use that file as the single source of truth for server structure, libraries,
configuration, request/response formats, and extension guidelines.
